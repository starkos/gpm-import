# gpm-tool

A bespoke script to import a [Google Play Music][gm] music collection from a [Google Takeout][gt] backup. Developed for my own personal use for a one-shot import. In theory, should work to import any Google Takeout GPM export, but I've only tested with my own. Fixes and improvements welcome.
